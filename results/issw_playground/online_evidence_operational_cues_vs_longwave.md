# Online Evidence Note: Operational Cues vs Longwave Emphasis

Purpose: provide defensible, non-accusatory support for the framing
`"field-observable cues are essential but incomplete without radiative forcing (especially LW)."`

## 1) What public avalanche education commonly emphasizes

### AIARE (public course framing)
- AIARE Rec Program framing emphasizes risk-management frameworks, planning, and rescue competencies at course-description level.
- Public-facing Rec course descriptions do not typically foreground longwave radiation as a standalone operational variable.

  - https://avtraining.org/aiare-courses/rec-courses/aiare-1/
  - https://avtraining.org/aiare-courses/rec-courses/aiare-2/

### Important nuance: advanced AIARE content does include LW
- The AIARE 2 student manual explicitly discusses longwave as a primary part of snowpack energy balance and links energy exchange to metamorphism.

### Avalanche.org (public red flags / field signs)
- Public avalanche red-flag guidance emphasizes observable conditions such as recent avalanches, recent loading, wind loading, and rapid warming.
- These are high-value field cues, but not explicit LW flux terms.

### Avalanche Canada (public tools and trip workflow)
- Avaluator and related public tools frame decisions around danger, terrain, and practical observations.
- Mountain Information Network weather summaries emphasize practical weather elements (temperature, precipitation, wind, cloud cover).

## 2) Evidence that LW is physically important for snow temperature

### Process-model sensitivity studies
- Pomeroy et al. (2016): surface-temperature simulations were sensitive to longwave irradiance and outperformed simple air/dewpoint proxies.
- Source:
  - https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0226.1

- Raleigh et al. (2016): forcing-availability tests showed large divergence in modeled SWE and snow-surface temperature when longwave was not observed and had to be estimated.
- Source:
  - https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0235.1

- Langer et al. (2011): in winter conditions, longwave radiation was reported as the dominant factor in surface energy balance at the study site.
- Source:
  - https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-5-509-2011

### Regional mountain snow context
- Rudisill et al. (2025): in snow-covered Upper Colorado basins, cloud radiative forcing was dominated by longwave warming effects in winter.

  - https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/69385/noaa_69385_DS1.pdf

### Operational measurement realism
- SLF station notes show snow-surface temperature is derived from outgoing longwave, and air-temperature sensors can have solar/no-wind warm bias in daytime.
- This supports using instrumented radiative data rather than "feel-only" interpretation.

## 3) Balanced claim you can defend

Recommended phrasing for abstract/paper:

`Public avalanche education and field workflows appropriately prioritize observable cues and decision frameworks. Advanced curricula include radiation concepts, but frontline field heuristics still rely heavily on what users can directly observe. Our results show those cues are necessary but not sufficient for thermal interpretation: cloud-modulated longwave forcing is a first-order driver of snow surface and gradient error in the tested winter window.`

This avoids:
- claiming avalanche education is "wrong,"
- claiming universal generalization from one site/month.

It supports:
- "why data tools matter" (LW cannot be inferred reliably by feel),
- a practical bridge from education to instrument-supported interpretation.

## 4) Suggested sentence for Rec 1 / Rec 2 teaching bridge

`What we can feel in the field (air temp, wind, sun) remains essential, but the snowpack also responds to sky-emitted radiation we cannot directly sense; this is where station data and simple physics tools add value.`
