## Abstract (Draft)
In the field, people often estimate snow warming and cooling from air temperature, wind, and sun. Those are important cues. But they miss heat coming from the sky and clouds (incoming longwave radiation, LW). We tested how much that missing piece matters.

We ran a simple 1-D snow temperature model at Senator Beck Basin, Colorado, for 1-31 January 2026, using USGS observations. We checked model output against measured non-contact snow surface temperature. We also evaluated temperature-gradient skill (how well the model captures the temperature difference through the snowpack).

With measured forcing, baseline skill was strong (surface RMSE 1.64 C, correlation 0.956; gradient RMSE 2.25 C/m). When we reduced incoming LW by 10%, surface RMSE increased by 1.05 C (+64%) and gradient RMSE increased by 2.72 C/m (+121%). Comparable turbulence changes were smaller: reducing sensible exchange by 30% increased surface RMSE by 0.29 C and gradient RMSE by 1.32 C/m; reducing latent exchange by 30% increased surface RMSE by 0.09 C and gradient RMSE by 0.31 C/m. In cloudy periods, replacing cloudy LW with clear-sky-like LW increased surface RMSE by 6.70 C and gradient RMSE by 10.50 C/m.

We also tested common shortcuts. Using air temperature as a surface-temperature proxy gave RMSE 7.22 C. Using (air-ground)/snow depth as a gradient proxy gave RMSE 9.44 C/m, versus 2.25 C/m for the physics model (76% lower error).

For this winter alpine case, radiation fidelity, especially LW, was a major control on both surface and gradient accuracy. Practical takeaway: field cues are necessary, but not sufficient; adding simple radiation-aware tools can reduce “by-feel” temperature and gradient mistakes relevant to avalanche interpretation.
