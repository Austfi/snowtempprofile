## Abstract text draft
[1-2 sentences: Problem]
Backcountry decision-making often assumes snow temperature can be inferred mainly from air temperature, sun, and wind. This can miss important radiative controls on snow surface temperature and near-surface thermal gradients that affect snowpack interpretation.

[1 sentence: Why this matters operationally]
We evaluate how forcing simplifications change both surface-temperature error and gradient error in terms relevant to avalanche practice.

[2-3 sentences: Method]
We used a minimal 1-D multilayer snow model with surface energy balance, forced by USGS meteorological and radiation observations. The primary validation target was non-contact measured snow surface temperature. We ran a controlled scenario suite (measured vs simplified longwave and shortwave forcing, plus turbulent and snow-depth perturbations) for [station] during [dates].

[2-3 sentences: Baseline + key quantitative findings]
Baseline model skill was RMSE [x] C and correlation [x]. A 10% LWdown perturbation increased surface RMSE by [x] C ([x]%) and gradient RMSE by [x] C/m ([x]%), which exceeded the impact of comparable latent/sensible perturbations in this window. A naive air-ground gradient proxy yielded RMSE [x] C/m versus [x] C/m for the physics model, a [x]% reduction in gradient error.

[1-2 sentences: Practical/education takeaway]
These results indicate that cloud-modulated longwave forcing is a first-order control on surface and gradient interpretation in this case, not a minor correction. For avalanche education and field workflow, radiation fidelity should be treated as core input to snow interpretation alongside terrain and forecast tools.

[1 sentence: Scope and limitations]
Findings are based on [n] winter windows at [n] site(s) with a minimal model and should be expanded across additional sites/regimes for broader generalization.
