## Abstract (Draft)
Backcountry avalanche decision-making often relies on directly observable weather cues such as air temperature, wind, and sun exposure. These cues are essential, but they do not fully represent the radiative controls that drive snow surface temperature and near-surface thermal gradients. We quantified how much error is introduced when key energy-balance forcings are simplified in a minimal, operationally practical snow model.

We ran a 1-D multilayer snow temperature model with a surface energy balance boundary condition, forced by USGS station observations at Senator Beck Basin (Colorado, USA) for 1-31 January 2026. The primary validation target was non-contact measured snow surface temperature (USGS parameter 72405). We evaluated a controlled scenario suite with perturbations to longwave (LW), shortwave (SW), turbulent fluxes, and snow depth, and assessed both surface-temperature skill and gradient skill using an observation-based gradient proxy.

Baseline skill was RMSE 1.64 C (correlation 0.956) for surface temperature, with gradient RMSE 2.25 C/m. A realistic 10% reduction in incoming LW increased surface RMSE by 1.05 C (+64% relative to baseline) and gradient RMSE by 2.72 C/m (+121%). Comparable turbulent perturbations were smaller: a 30% sensible reduction increased RMSE by 0.29 C and gradient RMSE by 1.32 C/m, while a 30% latent reduction increased RMSE by 0.09 C and gradient RMSE by 0.31 C/m. In cloud windows, replacing cloudy LW with clear-sky-like LW increased surface RMSE by 6.70 C and gradient RMSE by 10.50 C/m.

A practical benchmark showed that simple heuristics underperform for thermal interpretation: using air temperature as a surface proxy produced RMSE 7.22 C, and using (air-ground)/snow-depth as a gradient proxy produced RMSE 9.44 C/m versus 2.25 C/m for the physics model (76% reduction).

For this winter alpine case, radiation fidelity, especially LW, was a first-order control on both surface and gradient skill. This supports treating cloud-modulated radiation as a core variable in avalanche education and operational interpretation, rather than a secondary correction.
