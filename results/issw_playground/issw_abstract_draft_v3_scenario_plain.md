## Abstract (Draft)
Most field users estimate snow warming and cooling from three things they can directly observe: air temperature, wind, and sun. Those cues are essential. But they miss heat coming from the sky and clouds (incoming longwave radiation, LW), which is harder to sense without instruments. We tested how much this missing piece matters for avalanche-relevant snow interpretation.

We ran a simple 1-D snow temperature model at Senator Beck Basin, Colorado, for January 1-31, 2026, using USGS observations. We evaluated both snow surface temperature and snowpack temperature gradient, because both are used in practical snowpack reasoning.

In baseline mode, the model tracked measured surface temperature well (typical miss about 1.2 C; RMSE 1.64 C). But error depended strongly on weather type. The largest misses occurred in clear/calm windows, especially morning transition periods, where 6-hour-window RMSE reached about 5.3 C. The smallest misses occurred in cloudy or windy windows, often near 0.1-0.3 C RMSE.

When incoming LW was reduced by 10%, typical surface error increased by about 0.8 C, and gradient error increased by 2.72 C/m (more than doubling baseline gradient error). Comparable turbulent perturbations were smaller: reducing sensible exchange by 30% increased typical surface error by about 0.16 C, and reducing latent exchange by 30% increased it by about 0.10 C. In cloudy periods, forcing cloudy LW to behave like clear-sky LW increased surface error by about 6.7 C and gradient error by about 10.5 C/m.

A simple “by-feel” benchmark also underperformed: using air temperature as a surface proxy gave 7.22 C RMSE, and using (air-ground)/snow depth as a gradient proxy gave 9.44 C/m RMSE, versus 2.25 C/m for the physics model.

For this winter alpine case, the practical message is direct: field cues are necessary, but not sufficient. If we do not include sky radiation, especially LW, we can be confidently wrong about both surface temperature and gradient evolution.
